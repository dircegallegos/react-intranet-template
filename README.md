# Corporative Internal Website React Template

This code provides a simple yet informative internal website template for a company.
It's made of four React components:
- A menu card to show the day's caffeteria options
- A carousel of pictures for visual information
- A quick links card to access easily to useful documents, websites, or platforms.
- A card for important KPI indicators.

Also, it has a top bar to navigate through different modules or websites.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
